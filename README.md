# Gender Imbalance in Movies

I did a quick study of gender inequality in movies. In particular, I collected data from STAR WARS, RICK & MORTY, and the Movie Database APIs. Surprisingly, a Female:Male ratio of 1:3 prevails. The same is true for total credits. (I only collected the first 10000 characters from the Movie Database).

* **conf_api.ini** has the endpoints and specifications for the APIs
* **api_funcs.py** has the connectAPI class and its functions.
* **make_dashboard.py** connects to  the APIs, get data and create a dashboard with pie charts (See below).
* **film_gender_imbalance.ipynb** has further visualizations.
