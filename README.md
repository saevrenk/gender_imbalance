# Gender Inbalance in Movies

Investigated the gender inbalance in movies. In particular, I collected data from STAR WARS, RICK & MORTY and the Movie Database APIs. Surprisingly, a Female:Male ratio of 1:3 prevails. The same is true for total credits. (I only collected 10000 character data from the Movie Database). 

* **conf_api.ini** has the endpoints and specifications for the APIs
* **api_funcs.py** has the connectAPI class and its functions.
* **make_dashboard.py** connects to  the APIs, get data and create a dashboard with pie charts (See below).
* **film_gender_inbalance.ipynb** has further visualizations.
