# Gender Imbalance in Movies

I did a quick study of gender inequality in movies. In particular, I collected data from Star Wars, Rick and Morty, and the Movie Database APIs. Surprisingly, a **Female:Male** ratio of **1:3** prevails. The same is true for total credits. (I only collected the first 10000 characters from the Movie Database).

* **conf_api.ini** has the endpoints and specifications for the APIs.
* **api_funcs.py** has the connectAPI class.
* **make_dashboard.py** connects to  the APIs, get data and create a dashboard with pie charts as seen below.
* **film_gender_imbalance.ipynb** has further visualizations.
